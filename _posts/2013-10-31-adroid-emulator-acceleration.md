The android emulator if used as it comes from the package is pretty slow, so it is good to know that there are ways to make it a little faster.

## Graphics acceleration

To use this feature you need to have these versions installed:

  * Android SDK Tools, Revision 17 or higher
  * Android SDK Platform API 15, Revision 3 or higher

You can verify that you meet these requirements by launching the android app:

```
/path/to/android-sdk/tools/android
```

<!--more-->

And checking the following values:

Once the requirements have been met you want to create a virtual device that can use the acceleration. For this you can use the avd tool.

```
/path/to/android-sdk/tools/android avd
```

Create a device with target value of Android 4.0.3 (API Level 15), revision 3 or higher and run it using this command:

```
/path/to/android-sdk/tools/emulator -avd EmulatorName -gpu on
```

## Virtual machine acceleration

To make use of virtual machine acceleration you need to complete these requirements:

  * Android SDK Tools, Revision 17 or higher
  * Android x86-based system image

You can use the **android** command to make sure they are installed the same way you did for graphics acceleration. You will also need to Make sure your emulator uses x86 in the CPU/ABI field, to verify or change this value you can use **android avd** command.

You will also need to install kvm:

```
yum install kvm
```

Now you can use this command to use the acceleration:

```
/path/to/android-sdk/tools/emulator -avd EmulatorName -gpu on -qemu -enable-kvm
```

Now the simulator takes a lot less time to start and runs a lot faster.
