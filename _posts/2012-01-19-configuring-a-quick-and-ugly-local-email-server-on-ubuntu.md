Configuring an e-mail server for local testing on ubuntu is a really fast an easy task. You just need to install and configure sendmail with these commands:

```
sudo apt-get install sendmail
sudo sendmailconfig
```

The first command gets and installs sendmail from ubuntu repositories. The second command will run a configuration script that will ask you some questions about your configuration.

After you do this you have to add a fully qualified domain name to your hosts file or your server will not work.

Your hosts file should have something like this:

```
127.0.0.1 yourdomain.dev
```

You can really write the domain name you want but it needs to be fully qualified, that means it should contain a top level domain, in my example **dev**.
