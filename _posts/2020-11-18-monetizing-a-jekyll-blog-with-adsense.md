I've been writing this blog for a while and I recently thought it would be nice if it could help pay for the servers I use for my other projects. At the time of this writing, this blog gets around 25,000 views per month, which is not much, but might be enough to pay for a couple of virtual machines (Hopefully. I'll know more after I have ads running for some time).

Since this blog is built with Jekyll, I'm going to show how to add Adsense to similar blogs.

## Creating a site in Adsense

Before we can start adding ads to our site, we need to tell Google that the site is ours. To do that we need click `Add site` on the `Sites` section:

[<img src="/images/posts/adsense-add-site.png" alt="Adsense add site" />](/images/posts/adsense-add-site.png)

We will then get a code that we should put in the `<head>` of our website. The code looks something like this:

```html
<script data-ad-client="ca-pub-12345678987654321" async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
```

<!--more-->

Depending on the Jekyll theme we are using, we might have different layouts for different types of pages. For example, I have a layout for my main page and a different one for a single article page. We need to add the code above to all the pages where we want to show ads.

After adding the code, we need to wait a few days for the registration to complete.

## Auto Ads

Adsense has an `Auto ads` feature that let's Google choose the best places to show ads in a page. This option is easy to implement but might result in showing ads in places that are very disruptive for users.

To enable it, we need to `edit` our site:

[<img src="/images/posts/adsense-edit-site.png" alt="Adsense edit site" />](/images/posts/adsense-edit-site.png)

This takes us to a page where we can customize the ads we want to show for both desktop and mobile:

[<img src="/images/posts/adsense-auto-ads.png" alt="Adsense auto ads" />](/images/posts/adsense-auto-ads.png)

There are 3 types of ads offered at the time of this writing:

- In-page - Shows mixed with the page content
- Anchor - Pop-up that can be dismissed
- Vignette - Full screen ad shown when transitioning between pages

By looking at where the ads would be placed I decided I didn't like having Google decide where to put the ads. If you decide to go for this option, I suggest to stick to `in-page` ads since the other 2 are very disruptive.

After enabling `auto ads`, it might take a couple of hours to start working on our site.

## Ad units

A way to have more control over where we put our ads is by using `ad units`:

[<img src="/images/posts/adsense-by-ad-unit.png" alt="Adsense by ad unit" />](/images/posts/adsense-by-ad-unit.png)

`Display ads` are a good option that works for both mobile and desktop. To create a unit we just need to give it a name, choose the orientation and click `Create`:

[<img src="/images/posts/adsense-create-unit.png" alt="Adsense create unit" />](/images/posts/adsense-create-unit.png)

We will then be given a piece of code similar to the following:

```html
<script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
<!-- ncona-ad-unit -->
<ins class="adsbygoogle"
     style="display:block"
     data-ad-client="ca-pub-12345678987"
     data-ad-slot="1234567897"
     data-ad-format="auto"
     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins>
<script>
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script>
```

We can then create an include for this snippet (`_includes/adsense.html`):

```html
{% raw %}{% if jekyll.environment == "production" %}{% endraw %}
<script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
<!-- ncona-ad-unit -->
<ins class="adsbygoogle"
     style="display:block"
     data-ad-client="ca-pub-12345678987"
     data-ad-slot="1234567897"
     data-ad-format="auto"
     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins>
<script>
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script>
{% raw %}{% endif %}{% endraw %}
```

And then add this include wherever we want to show an ad. This is how my post layout looks:

```html
---
layout: blog
---

<article class="post">
 <div class="space-extra-small">
 </div>

  <div class="entry">
    {% raw %}{{ content }}{% endraw %}
  </div>

  <span>[
    {% raw %}{% for tag in page.tags %}{% endraw %}
      {% raw %}{% capture tag_name %}{{ tag }}{% endcapture %}{% endraw %}
      {% raw %}<a href="/tag/{{ tag_name }}/"><code class="highligher-rouge"><nobr>{{ tag_name }}</nobr></code>&nbsp;</a>{% endraw %}
    {% raw %}{% endfor %}{% endraw %}
  ]</span>

  {% raw %}{% include adsense.html %}{% endraw %}
  {% raw %}{% include share-bar.html %}{% endraw %}
  {% raw %}{% include related-posts.html %}{% endraw %}
  {% raw %}{% include disqus.html %}{% endraw %}
</article>
```

Ads don't have any margins by default, so they look a little crowded.

[<img src="/images/posts/adsense-no-margin.png" alt="Adsense no margin" />](/images/posts/adsense-no-margin.png)

We can add some margins with css (`style.scss`):

```css
.adsbygoogle {
  margin-top: 12px;
  margin-bottom: 12px;
}
```

## Paginate

I use [jekyll-paginate](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/pagination/) to generate a paginated listing of all my posts. My index page looks something like this:

```html
...
  {% raw %}{% for post in paginator.posts %}{% endraw %}
  <article class="post">
    {% raw %}<h1><a href="{{post.url | prepend: site.baseurl}}">{{ post.title }}</a></h1>{% endraw %}

    <div class="entry">
      {% raw %}{{ post.excerpt }}{% endraw %}
    </div>

    {% raw %}<a href="{{post.url | prepend: site.baseurl}}" class="button button-primary">Read More</a>{% endraw %}

  </article>
  {% raw %}{% endfor %}{% endraw %}
...
```

I want to show ads on this page, but I don't want to show an ad for each post.

Since each of my pages contains a maximum of 10 posts, I'm going to show an ad after the second post and another one after the sixth:

```html
...
  {% raw %}{% for post in paginator.posts %}{% endraw %}
  <article class="post">
    {% raw %}<h1><a href="{{post.url | prepend: site.baseurl}}">{{ post.title }}</a></h1>{% endraw %}

    <div class="entry">
      {% raw %}{{ post.excerpt }}{% endraw %}
    </div>

    {% raw %}<a href="{{post.url | prepend: site.baseurl}}" class="button button-primary">Read More</a>{% endraw %}

    {% raw %}{% if forloop.index == 2 or forloop.index == 6 %}{% endraw %}
    {% raw %}{% include adsense.html %}{% endraw %}
    {% raw %}{% endif %}{% endraw %}

  </article>
  {% raw %}{% endfor %}{% endraw %}
...
```

Because I'm using the same snippet (`adsense.html`) in both places, they will always show the same ad. To add a little variety we can create a new ad unit from the Google Adsense console and create a new snippet for it. We can then use a different snippet for each position:

```html
...
  {% raw %}{% for post in paginator.posts %}{% endraw %}
  <article class="post">
    {% raw %}<h1><a href="{{post.url | prepend: site.baseurl}}">{{ post.title }}</a></h1>{% endraw %}

    <div class="entry">
      {% raw %}{{ post.excerpt }}{% endraw %}
    </div>

    {% raw %}<a href="{{post.url | prepend: site.baseurl}}" class="button button-primary">Read More</a>{% endraw %}

    {% raw %}{% if forloop.index == 2 %}{% endraw %}
    {% raw %}{% include adsense.html %}{% endraw %}
    {% raw %}{% endif %}{% endraw %}
    {% raw %}{% if forloop.index == 6 %}{% endraw %}
    {% raw %}{% include adsense-2.html %}{% endraw %}
    {% raw %}{% endif %}{% endraw %}

  </article>
  {% raw %}{% endfor %}{% endraw %}
...
```

We will now see a different ad on each position.

## Ads.txt

In our adsense console we might be getting a message talking about `ads.txt`:

```
Earnings at risk - You need to fix some ads.txt file issues to avoid severe impact to your revenue.
```

This basically means that we need to create an `ads.txt` file and upload it to our site. This file tells the browser which advertisers are allowed to show content on our site. If we click the `Fix it` link next to the alert, we will have the option to download a file. We need to upload this file and make it available at `<ourdomain>/ads.txt`.

## Conclusion

In this article I showed how we can start showing ads in a Jekyll site to make some money from a blog. I personally don't like having Google choose where to put ads, so I showed how to place our ads manually using `ad units`.
