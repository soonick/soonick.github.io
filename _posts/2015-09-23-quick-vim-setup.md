Once again I changed computers and had to install and configure Vim so it works the way I like it. This time I was a little smarter and created a script that I can use in the future to install it and configure it with one command.

It will install the latest version of vim(from github), download and install the most useful plugins and create a .vimrc file. Just clone the [get-vim github project](https://github.com/soonick/get-vim) and run:

```
./do.sh
```

And you are set. Hope it is useful.
